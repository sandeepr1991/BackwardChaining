To check the spread of the infectious disease Tebola, the National Center for Epidemic Control
(NCEC) is preparing a large taskforce in identifying early symptoms of the disease. After a series
of meetings with the experts, the NCEC has concluded that a practical way to set forth would
be to train the taskforce in using a medical knowledge base for early identification of symptoms
and infected people. This would allow expert knowledge to be widely available through the
knowledge base and minimize human error.

You have been hired by the NCEC to facilitate the training of the taskforce in using the
knowledge base. Each trainee is presented with disease related information in form of first
order logic clauses. The trainee can read the clauses in the knowledge base and provide a logical
conclusion that is provable from the clauses. You are required to develop a program that can
check the conclusion made by the trainee and provide a quick feedback about whether the
conclusion is right or not. The trainee can thus be trained to make conclusions using the
knowledge base.
